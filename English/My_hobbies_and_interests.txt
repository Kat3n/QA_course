Hello! My name's Kate. I'm thirty four. I from Zhlobin, Belarus. Many things are interesting to me. it is reading, music, yoga, meditation. Most of all I like to draw and swim.
There is nice pool in my city. Its length is fifty meters. I started going to the pool six or seven years ago. And I could not swim more than seven hundred meters. Now I'm swimming one thousand seven hundred meters. My record is two thousand four hundred meters.
