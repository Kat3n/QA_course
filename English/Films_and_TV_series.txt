I like to watch interesting films and TV series. For me this is a good way to relax from work or study. I like comedies, melodrams, horrors, detectives, but most of all apocalypse movies. I watch films that evoke different emoions in me: happiness, sadness, tears, fear, laughter. I don't like action movies. I love watching movies with my favorite actors.This is Cameron Diaz, Anne Hathaway, Jason Statham, russian actress Irina Gorbacheva and many others. I like Russian arthouse films. I really like Anna Melikyan's films. I often go to the cinemawith my friends and children. We watch cartoons with children. The lastcartoon I liked is "Raya and the last dragon". 
Of course I watch series. If I really lke the series then I watch it until late at night. When I watched "Game of Thrones" I slept very less. I like short comedy series now.I try not to watch TV series because it takes a lot of time.
