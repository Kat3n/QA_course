I'm interested in sports but not much. I can read anything on the news. Most of all I like to watch the opening ceremony. This is a fantastic show. I watch figyre skating. This is one of my favorite sports. I always wanted to skate as well.But I skate very badly. I really like rhythmic gymnastics. I think these sports are very beautiful.
Also I can watch the fotball championship with my friends. 
I don't have much time now. I try to devote time to sports. Sports makes me stronger, makes me feel better and brings joy. 
Most of all I like swimming. I swim well. My record two thousand four hundred meters on fifty or fifty five minutes. I like crowl. After training I feel active, rested and ready to do a lot of things.
Swimmer A.Gerasimenia came to the sports complex of my city. She talked about herself, talked with children and spent with them a master class.
